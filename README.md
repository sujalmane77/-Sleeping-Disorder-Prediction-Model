Sleep Disorder Prediction using Naive Bayes (from Scratch)
This project implements a Naive Bayes classifier from scratch in Python to predict sleep disorders using a transformed dataset. It involves data preprocessing, probability calculation, prediction logic, and accuracy evaluation—without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

Dataset
File: Sleep_dataset.csv
The dataset contains features related to individuals' sleep patterns and attributes.
The target variable is Sleep Disorder, which includes classes like Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, and None.

This project is built without using external machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow. It’s a great beginner-friendly example to understand the inner workings of Naive Bayes classification.
